###Changes made by Lorenzo Chiabrando###


1) Added two mains, one for analyses using general functions and the other for the version with mass action.

2) Added a new file for the definition of transitions with general functions, related to the holling type 3 + modified the existing file on the holling type 2. Now corrected and functional.

3) Deleted msqd and Target .R files, now these functions are all contained in the single file Function.R

4) Added a file for plot functions on sensitivity and analysis, which were not present before.

5) Modified the ReadMe.md and ReadMe.html files

6) Added images of mathematical formulas with a white background, so they are better displayed in the GitHub repository

7) Modified the GreatSPN files, one is dedicated to networks for general transitions (Lotka-Volterra-General.PNPRO) the other remained unchanged.

8) Deleted unnecessary folders (those obtained from analyses/sensitivity) as they can be generated when running main.R

9) Modified the Input files and added a file with parameters for the holling type 3
